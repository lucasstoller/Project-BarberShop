# Project-BarberShop
This is a first part of a college project that i should create a website to prove that i learned the contents of dicipline. So i decided to choose a Barber Shop's site. In this project was forbidden to use any Framework, just pure CSS3, HTML5 and JS (futurely).
----------------------------
The website is a single page and futurely i'm gonna to upgrade it using JS (at the second part of project) althougth you can fork, improve it and do a pull request that i'll measure :D
